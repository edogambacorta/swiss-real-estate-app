# Active Context

## Recent Changes

1. Created src/swiss_cities_database.py:
   - Implemented SwissCitiesDatabase class to store and manage city information
   - Added data for 10 important Swiss cities including population, canton, location, languages, and notable features

2. Updated src/swiss_real_estate_agent.py:
   - Modified get_city_overview method to use the new SwissCitiesDatabase
   - Implemented fallback to existing methods if city not found in the database

3. Updated src/ui.py:
   - Removed the "Analyze Properties" button and its associated functionality
   - Removed one instance of the "City Overview" header
   - Updated the render_city_overview function to display all five key elements

4. Updated memory bank files:
   - Updated activeContext.md to reflect recent changes
   - Updated techContext.md to include the new SwissCitiesDatabase

## Current Focus

- Ensuring accurate and up-to-date city information in the SwissCitiesDatabase
- Improving user experience with comprehensive city overviews
- Maintaining robust error handling and API security measures
- Exploring potential uses for Watchdog in automating tasks and monitoring file system events

## Next Steps

1. Expand the SwissCitiesDatabase to include more Swiss cities
2. Implement a mechanism to regularly update city information
3. Add unit tests for the SwissCitiesDatabase and related functions
4. Optimize performance of city-based filtering and analysis
5. Consider adding visualization tools for city-level data comparisons
6. Explore integration with city-specific real estate databases or APIs
7. Implement user preferences for default city selection
8. Investigate and implement Watchdog for relevant file monitoring tasks (e.g., watching for updates in city data files)

## Active Decisions and Considerations

- Balancing the level of detail in city-specific analysis with overall application performance
- Considering the potential need for regular updates to city-specific information and market data
- Evaluating the user experience of city-based features and gathering feedback for improvements
- Assessing the impact of city-specific features on API usage and potential rate limiting

## Known Issues

- The SwissCitiesDatabase currently contains information for only 10 major Swiss cities. More cities need to be added for comprehensive coverage.
- The fallback methods for city information (when a city is not found in the database) may not provide as detailed or accurate information as the database entries.

This active context reflects the current state of the project as of the latest updates to incorporate the SwissCitiesDatabase and improve city overview functionality. It will be updated as the project evolves and new changes are implemented.
