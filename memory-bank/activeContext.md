# Active Context

## Recent Changes

1. Updated src/swiss_real_estate_agent.py:
   - Removed API key parameters from the SwissPropertyAgent constructor
   - Implemented error handling for missing or invalid API keys
   - Added try-except blocks for API calls to handle potential errors

2. Updated src/ui.py:
   - Removed API key input fields from the UI
   - Updated error handling for SwissPropertyAgent initialization and API calls
   - Improved user feedback for API-related errors

3. Updated README.md:
   - Added more detailed instructions for setting up the .env file
   - Expanded the section on API key security and error handling
   - Included guidance on troubleshooting API key-related issues

## Current Focus

- Ensuring robust error handling throughout the application
- Improving user experience by providing clear feedback on API-related issues
- Maintaining up-to-date documentation for developers and users

## Next Steps

1. Implement unit tests for the API key loading process and error handling
2. Consider adding more Swiss-specific features, such as:
   - Integrating more detailed Swiss real estate regulations
   - Enhancing canton-specific filtering and analysis
3. Optimize performance of property searches and trend analysis
4. Explore options for data persistence (e.g., saving user searches or favorite properties)

## Active Decisions and Considerations

- Prioritized security and error handling in the recent updates
- Considering the balance between providing detailed error messages and maintaining API security
- May need to provide more guidance for users on obtaining API keys from Firecrawl and OpenAI

## Known Issues
