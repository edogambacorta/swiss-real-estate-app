# Active Context

## Recent Changes

1. Implemented secure API key management:
   - Created a .env file for storing API keys as environment variables
   - Updated src/ui.py to load API keys from environment variables instead of user input
   - Added python-dotenv to requirements.txt for loading environment variables

2. Updated README.md:
   - Added instructions for setting up the .env file
   - Included a section on API key security best practices

3. Created Memory Bank:
   - Established memory-bank directory
   - Created techContext.md to document technical aspects of the project
   - Created this activeContext.md file to track recent changes and current focus

## Current Focus

- Ensuring secure handling of API keys throughout the application
- Improving user experience by removing the need for manual API key entry
- Maintaining up-to-date documentation for developers and users

## Next Steps

1. Review and potentially update src/swiss_real_estate_agent.py to ensure it's compatible with the new API key management approach
2. Implement error handling for cases where API keys are missing or invalid
3. Consider adding unit tests for the API key loading process
4. Update any deployment scripts or documentation to reflect the new .env file requirement

## Active Decisions and Considerations

- Decided to use environment variables for API key management to enhance security
- Considering the trade-off between security and user convenience (no need to enter API keys in UI, but requires initial setup of .env file)
- May need to provide more detailed instructions for users on how to obtain API keys and set up the .env file

## Known Issues

- None currently identified related to recent changes

This active context reflects the current state of the project as of the latest update to the API key management system. It will be updated as the project evolves and new changes are implemented.
