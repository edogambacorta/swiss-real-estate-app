# Active Context

## Recent Changes

1. Created src/cantons.py:
   - Added a comprehensive list of all 26 Swiss cantons
   - Implemented functions for canton name and code conversions

2. Updated src/swiss_real_estate_agent.py:
   - Added canton-specific property filtering
   - Implemented canton-level statistics retrieval
   - Enhanced property analysis to include canton-specific insights
   - Added canton-based market trend analysis

3. Updated src/ui.py:
   - Integrated canton selection dropdown with all 26 cantons
   - Added canton-specific property filtering in the search interface
   - Implemented display of canton-level statistics and market trends
   - Added canton-specific regulations section

4. Updated README.md:
   - Added information about new canton-based features
   - Updated usage instructions to include canton-specific functionality
   - Expanded the features list to highlight canton-related capabilities

5. Installed Watchdog module:
   - Added Watchdog to requirements.txt
   - Updated techContext.md to include Watchdog in the list of technologies used

6. Updated src/ui.py to improve image loading:
   - Enhanced error handling in the `load_image` function
   - Implemented a retry mechanism for image loading
   - Added logging for better debugging of image loading issues
   - Updated the `display_property` function to handle image loading failures gracefully

## Current Focus

- Enhancing the application with comprehensive canton-based functionality
- Ensuring accurate and up-to-date canton-specific data and analysis
- Improving user experience with canton-level insights and filtering
- Maintaining robust error handling and API security measures
- Exploring potential uses for Watchdog in automating tasks and monitoring file system events

## Next Steps

1. Implement unit tests for canton-related functions and features
2. Enhance canton-specific real estate regulations with more detailed information
3. Optimize performance of canton-based filtering and analysis
4. Consider adding visualization tools for canton-level data comparisons
5. Explore integration with canton-specific real estate databases or APIs
6. Implement user preferences for default canton selection
7. Investigate and implement Watchdog for relevant file monitoring tasks (e.g., watching for updates in property data files)

## Active Decisions and Considerations

- Balancing the level of detail in canton-specific analysis with overall application performance
- Considering the potential need for regular updates to canton-specific regulations and market data
- Evaluating the user experience of canton-based features and gathering feedback for improvements
- Assessing the impact of canton-specific features on API usage and potential rate limiting

## Known Issues

- Image loading errors were occurring for certain images. This has been addressed with improved error handling and a retry mechanism, but the root cause (potentially related to image format or server issues) may still need further investigation.

This active context reflects the current state of the project as of the latest updates to incorporate comprehensive canton-based functionality and improve image loading reliability. It will be updated as the project evolves and new changes are implemented.
